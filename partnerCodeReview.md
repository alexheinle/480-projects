#### Formatting/legibility/style

The formatting and legibility of this project is great. She has many
documentations that clearly discuss and explain the project and her research.
There is a clear abstract that summarizes everything that one needs to know
and understand about the robot which makes for good styling for users.

#### Best Practices

Some of the best practices of this project is the organization and explanation.
Considering this project was presented to Congress, only the best practices had
to be used to showcase the research. It is very easy to understand and she uses
great examples and documentation.

#### Reliability

As I can see, this project can only get better and increase into something
larger.  I think this project is reliable considering all of the backround knowledge
that she has in both of her majors combined along with the research that went along
with the environmental side and computer science side.

#### Testability

To test this project, it is really just a test run with the robot while it is
submerged in water. If something goes wrong, then she will be able to visually
see the issues and fix them.
